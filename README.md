# Certificate App

## Project Overview

This project, hosted at [rudrashisgorai/Certificate-app](https://github.com/rudrashisgorai/Certificate-app), is a Streamlit-based web application for generating personalized certificates. Users can enter their name, and the app dynamically generates a certificate with the provided name.

## Features

- **Personalized Certificate Generation**: Generates a certificate with a user-provided name.
- **Custom Font and Text Placement**: Utilizes custom fonts and calculates text placement for aesthetic appeal.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive web app experience.
- **Image Processing with PIL**: Uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image manipulation.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudrashisgorai/Certificate-app.git
cd Certificate-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will be available in your web browser.

## App Workflow

1. **Input Name**: The user inputs their name into the text field.
2. **Certificate Generation**: On providing the name, the app generates a certificate with the name placed in a predefined position.
3. **Visualization**: The generated certificate is displayed within the app using Plotly.
